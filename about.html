    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hey! I’m Onail Nissan — a student in the final stretch of finishing my Bachelor’s degree in Data Analytics and Programming.</p>
    <p>It’s been a rewarding journey, and I’ve genuinely enjoyed learning tools like Python, SQL, Excel, Power BI, and Tableau along the way. Whether it's building dashboards, exploring datasets, or writing code to dig up insights — I love every part of the process.</p>
    <p>I’m passionate about turning data into clear, meaningful stories, and I'm always excited to keep learning and growing. Can’t wait to see where this leads next!</p>
